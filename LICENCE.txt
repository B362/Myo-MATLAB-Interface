                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate

Myo SDK license agreement

Version Date: December 17, 2014

Thanks for your interest in the Myo armband from Thalmic Labs!  We are excited that you want to develop software using our Myo SDK.  Your use of our Myo SDK is subject to our Myo SDK license terms, as set forth here.  By using the Myo SDK, you are agreeing to adhere to and be bound by these terms, and also signifying that you can legally be bound by these terms.  If you are using the Myo SDK to develop software on behalf of a third party, like your employer, you are also agreeing to these terms on their behalf and you must have the authority to bind them to these terms.  If you do not or cannot agree, then we do not permit you to use, and you must not use, the Myo SDK in any way.

THE BOTTOM LINE:  The Myo SDK is being provided to you free of charge, so you are accepting all risks in using the Myo SDK, and you are also agreeing to be liable for anything arising from your use of the Myo SDK, such as software you develop.  We own and are responsible for the Myo SDK; you own and are responsible for any software you develop using the Myo SDK, but if you develop any gesture recognition algorithms using the Myo SDK, you will let us use them at no charge and without any restrictions.  We will only be responsible for issues relating to the Myo SDK that are wholly within our control, and then only to the limited extent that the law says that we must be responsible.

THE DETAILS (NUMBERED SUMMARY HEADINGS PROVIDED FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY):

1. You and Thalmic Labs are entering into this agreement.

The parties to this agreement are you, on behalf of yourself as an individual and/or as a representative of an employer, company or other third party entity (being the party for whose benefit the Myo SDK is being used), and Thalmic Labs Inc., an Ontario corporation with principal place of business at 24 Charles Street West, Kitchener, ON N2G 1H2 (Thalmic).

2. This is a license agreement allowing you to develop Applications using the Myo SDK.

This is a software license agreement for the Myo SDK (meaning the system files, redistributables, libraries, tools, data, APIs, sample code, documentation, and other software materials, as well as any updates to the foregoing, which are made available to you by Thalmic in connection with this agreement) for use in developing Applications (meaning any software developed, built, created, or otherwise produced using the Myo SDK) for the Myo armband (meaning the Myo gesture control armband).

3. You can develop Applications as long as you comply with all laws, do not damage us or the Myo SDK in any way, and use the Myo SDK the way we have said it is intended to be used.  You are free to copy, distribute, modify, and create derivative works of the sample code that we provide and to redistribute the redistributable files that are necessary for your Application to run.

Subject to the terms of this agreement, Thalmic grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the Myo SDK solely to develop Applications for the Myo armband.  Your Application and your use of the Myo SDK must comply with: (a) this agreement, and (b) any applicable laws, regulations or other mandatory requirements applicable to you and/or the Application (including any laws regarding the export of data or software).

Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses (if any), you may not: (a) copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Myo SDK or any part of the Myo SDK.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are permitted to modify and/or create derivative works of any sample code included in the Myo SDK, to distribute such modifications and/or derivative works of sample code with your Application, and, if your employer is bound by this agreement, to copy/redistribute the Myo SDK to other employees of your employer.  You are also permitted to redistribute, with your Application, any redistributable file from the Myo SDK (such as myo.dll in the Windows version, myo.framework in the Mac version, and the like) that is required in order for your Application to run.

You agree that if you use the Myo SDK to develop an Application for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users.  You also agree that you will not engage in any illicit or illegal activity with the Myo SDK, including the development or distribution of any Application that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party, including Thalmic.

4. There may be software in the Myo SDK owned by third parties (i.e., not Thalmic and not you), so when you use the Myo SDK, you need to comply with their license agreements as well.

Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the Myo SDK licensed under a third party software license (including but not limited to an open source software license) are governed solely by the terms of that third party software license and not this agreement.  Such licenses, if applicable, may be found in the documentation accompanying the Myo SDK.

5. We own everything else having to do with the Myo SDK and the Myo armband (except the third party software mentioned in #4 above).

You agree that Thalmic or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Myo SDK, including any intellectual property rights (patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc.) that subsist in the Myo SDK.  You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Myo SDK.  Thalmic reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under this agreement.

Thalmic reserves the right to discontinue, change or remove features, or change the form and nature of the Myo SDK at any time without notice.  Future versions of the Myo SDK may be incompatible with Applications developed on previous versions of the Myo SDK.  This agreement may also be modified by Thalmic in future versions of the Myo SDK, and you are responsible for ensuring that you and your Application(s) are in compliance with the then-current version.

6. You own your Application, but Thalmic does get full license rights to any gesture recognition algorithms that you may develop using the Myo SDK.  Ongoing compatibility between your Application and the Myo armband / Myo SDK is your responsibility, not the responsibility of Thalmic.  You are also accountable for anything to do with your Application (such as how it is developed, licensed or sold, and its operation), and for your handling of any third party data that you collect through the Myo armband or your Application.

With the exception of any algorithms, methods, processes, or techniques for gesture recognition (Algorithms) that you develop using the Myo SDK, Thalmic agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under this agreement in or to any Application(s) that you develop, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in such Application(s).  If you develop any Algorithms, you hereby grant to Thalmic an irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, and non-exclusive license to execute, copy, reproduce, perform, make, produce, modify, maintain, sell, market, promote, distribute, export, import, transmit, broadcast, sub-license, create derivative works of, and otherwise use in any way that Thalmic deems appropriate, any such Algorithm.  You agree to share full details of any Algorithm that you develop with Thalmic, including data and source code if applicable, upon request by Thalmic.

You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Thalmic has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you and/or users of your Application create, collect, or transmit by a Myo armband and/or by your Application, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Thalmic may suffer) by doing so.  AS INFORMATION AND DATA THAT YOU COLLECT BY USING THE MYO ARMBAND AND/OR YOUR APPLICATION MAY BE CONSIDERED THIRD PARTY PERSONAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS (INCLUDING PRIVACY LAWS) RESPECTING SUCH COLLECTION, INCLUDING BY OBTAINING ALL RELEVANT PERMISSIONS FROM ANY PERSONS TO COLLECT AND USE SUCH INFORMATION AND DATA IN THE MANNER THAT YOU CONTEMPLATE.  You agree that you are solely responsible for the operation, marketing, compatibility, and all other aspects of your Application(s), and for complying with all applicable laws regarding such Application(s).  Thalmic expressly disclaims all liability for any claims, losses or damages arising from your Application(s), your marketing, distribution or other handling of such Application(s), and/or your collection and/or handling of data and information through the Myo armband or the Application, and you agree to indemnify Thalmic against all such claims, losses and damages, in accordance with this agreement.

7. We are providing the Myo SDK without any warranties, and you are accepting all risk in using the Myo SDK.  We have no liability to you for any damages relating to your use of the Myo SDK or your reliance on any data that you may obtain through your use of the Myo SDK.

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE MYO SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE MYO SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM THALMIC.  THALMIC EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DURABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY OTHER WARRANTY OR CONDITION ARISING BY STATUTE, CUSTOM OR USAGE OF TRADE RELATED TO THE MYO SDK PROVIDED HEREUNDER.  THALMIC SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE MYO SDK WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  In particular, you acknowledge that Thalmic does not warrant or recommend the Myo armband for use in any application (such as vehicular control) for which a failure or fault may result in death, personal injury or damage to property.
YOUR USE OF THE MYO SDK AND ANY MATERIAL PRODUCED, DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE MYO SDK, INCLUDING ANY DATA YOU COLLECT AND ANY APPLICATION(S) YOU DEVELOP, IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO ANY PERSON OR PROPERTY OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.  Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, under no circumstance will Thalmic be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on, or use of, any information or data obtained through the Myo SDK, your Application or otherwise through the Myo armband, and it is solely your responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any such data or information.

Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties and conditions.  To the extent permitted by law, any implied warranties or conditions relating to the Myo SDK, to the extent that they cannot be excluded as set out above, are limited to thirty (30) days from the date that you first download the Myo SDK.

The only type of damages that can be recovered against Thalmic arising from or related to this agreement (including without limitation in relation to the Myo armband, the Myo SDK and your use under this agreement thereof), shall be your direct damages, if any, to the extent arising from gross negligence of or wilful misconduct by Thalmic.  In no event shall the aggregate liability of Thalmic exceed the amount paid by you for the portion of the Myo SDK that gave rise to the claim.  EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED DIRECT DAMAGES SPECIFIED ABOVE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THALMIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, FAILURES TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA, COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE FAILURE, PROBLEMS, LOSS OR DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY USE OF THE MYO SDK, YOUR APPLICATION(S), OR THE MYO ARMBAND, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT), WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE MYO SDK, EVEN IF THALMIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. We want our customers to have a consistent and enjoyable experience and wish to protect our name and reputation, so you need to follow our guidelines in developing your Application and in referencing us or our products.

You agree to follow the guidelines for the naming, branding, and general presentation of Applications for the Myo armband, viewable at https://developer.getmyo.com/branding and the guidelines for the user experience provided by Applications for the Myo armband, viewable at https://developer.getmyo.com/ux (collectively, the Guidelines).

Thalmic reserves the right to update and/or modify the Guidelines at any time in its sole discretion.  You must ensure that any Application that you develop complies with the current Guidelines before you distribute the Application.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, you are prohibited from making any references to Thalmic, the Myo armband, the Myo SDK, or any other Thalmic products and services (whether in conjunction with your Application or otherwise), and especially shall not make any representations, guarantees or warranties to any third party in relation to Thalmic, the Myo armband, the Myo SDK, or any other Thalmic products and services.  Except to the limited extent provided by the Guidelines, nothing in this agreement gives you a right to use any of the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other brand features owned by Thalmic.

9. Unless you opt-out, we may automatically collect certain information from your use of the Myo SDK to help us improve our products and services.  The same goes for users of your Application, and your use of an Application developed by a third party.

In order to continually innovate and improve the Myo SDK and/or the Myo armband, Thalmic may collect certain usage statistics related to the Myo SDK, Applications, and/or the Myo armband, including without limitation: a unique identifier of the Myo armband being used, an associated IP address, a version number of the Myo SDK and/or Application, a version number of the firmware of the Myo armband being used, information on which tools and/or services in the Myo SDK and/or Application are being used and how they are being used, and/or gesture data collected and stored during use of the Myo SDK and/or Application.  Any or all of this information may be transmitted to Thalmic from you unless you opt out of data collection as described in the documentation accompanying the Myo SDK.  Likewise, any or all of this information may be transmitted to Thalmic from users of your Application unless users of your Application opt out of data collection as described in the documentation accompanying the Myo SDK.  It is your responsibility to inform users of your Application that this information may be automatically collected and to ensure that your Application is compatible with the opt out technique(s) described in the documentation accompanying the Myo SDK.  The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the Myo SDK and/or the Myo armband and is maintained in accordance with the Thalmic Privacy Policy, available at: https://thalmic.com/privacy.

10. As part of your acceptance of risks under this agreement, you bear full responsibility for any claims made against us due to your Application and/or your acts or omissions, but you will not be responsible for any claims caused use of the Algorithms by Thalmic.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Thalmic, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of: (a) your access, use or misuse of the Myo SDK and/or the Myo armband, (b) your Application or other code developed or marketed by you in using the Myo SDK, (c) any breach of this agreement by you, (d) the infringement by you, or any third party obtaining access to the Myo SDK or Application through you, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or (e) your violation of any third-party rights or any applicable laws.  Thalmic reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Thalmic, at your expense, in asserting any available defences.  The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the extent that any claim or demand is caused solely by use of the Algorithms by Thalmic pursuant to the license granted to Thalmic in Section 6.

11. This agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Thalmic.

If you want to terminate this agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the Myo SDK.  Thalmic may at any time, terminate this agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of this agreement; (B) Thalmic is required to do so by law; (C) Thalmic decides to no longer make available the Myo SDK or certain parts of the Myo SDK to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Myo SDK; or (D) the provision of the Myo SDK to you by Thalmic is, in the sole discretion of Thalmic, no longer commercially viable.

When this agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Thalmic have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time while this agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 12 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

12. This section explains how this agreement will be interpreted and enforced.

This agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between the parties governing your use of the Myo SDK and completely replaces any prior agreement(s) between the parties in relation to the Myo SDK.  This agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, without regard to conflict of laws provisions, and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Province of Ontario, Canada.  The parties expressly agree that neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall apply to this agreement.  If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  You agree that if Thalmic does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in this agreement (or which Thalmic has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a waiver of any Thalmic rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Thalmic.  The rights granted in this agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either party without the prior written approval of the other party.  Neither party shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under this agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
